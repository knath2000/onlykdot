## 1. Current Focus

- **Modal Popup Scrollability & Border Confinement:** The modal popups for project details are now fully scrollable, with all content visually confined within the animated border. Accessibility and keyboard navigation have been enhanced.
- **Accessibility:** Focus trapping and keyboard navigation in modals are now robust, using FocusTrap with clickOutsideDeactivates.
- **UI Polish:** Padding for modal content is now dynamically calculated based on the animated border's strokeWidth, ensuring content never overlaps the border.
- **Other Ongoing:** Project detail page thumbnails and font loading issues remain as secondary focuses.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Scrollable Modal Implementation:**
    - Imported and wrapped the modal detail pane in FocusTrap (with clickOutsideDeactivates) to preserve keyboard navigation and focus trapping.
    - Updated the inner modal container to use `overflow-hidden`, `max-h-[80vh]`, `max-w-sm`, `flex flex-col`, and rounded corners.
    - Replaced fixed padding with `style={{ padding: calc(1.5rem + strokeWidth) }}` on the scrollable content container (`overflow-y-auto`, `max-h-full`), ensuring content is always inset from the animated border.
    - Verified `AnimatedBorder` remains absolutely positioned (`inset-0`, `pointer-events-none`) and overlays correctly.
    - Verified accessibility and keyboard navigation.
- **Transition Fade, Overlay, and Sphere Interactivity:** No changes since last update.
- **Astro/React Integration:** No changes since last update.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Continue UI/UX Testing:** Test modal accessibility and scrollability on all supported devices and browsers.
- **Monitor for Edge Cases:** Watch for any content overflow or border overlap issues with unusual content.
- **Finalize Thumbnail and Font Fixes:** Complete fixes for project detail page thumbnails and font loading errors.
- **Document Patterns:** Ensure new modal and border patterns are reflected in systemPatterns.md and .clinerules.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Project Detail Page Thumbnails:** Thumbnails defined in project frontmatter are not appearing on the dynamic project detail pages.
- **Font Loading:** 404 errors for missing font files.
- **Preload Warnings:** Fonts not used within a few seconds (likely related to 404s).
