# Active Context: Personal Portfolio Website (as of 2025-04-15 ~4:30 AM PST)

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Vercel Deployment (Completed):** Successfully deployed to Vercel after resolving build issues
    *   **(DONE):** Fixed BaseLayout import issue in projects.astro
    *   **(DONE):** Resolved compiler errors by resetting to stable commit (5809f3d)
    *   **(DONE):** Verified successful build and deployment

*   **Performance Optimization (Homepage - Deployed):** Addressing issues identified in Lighthouse report (Score: 83).
    *   **(DONE):** Address render-blocking resources (Self-hosted fonts in WOFF2 format with font-display: swap).
    *   **(DONE):** Optimize LCP image (`code-brackets-icon.png`) by adding `fetchpriority="high"` and preloading.
    *   **(DONE):** Optimize texture images (`particle.png`, `mail.png`, `user.png`, `code-brackets-icon.png`) by moving to `src/assets` for Astro optimization.
    *   **(DONE):** Fix Vercel build failure by uninstalling unused `react-spring`.
    *   **(DONE):** Configured Vercel compression (Brotli/gzip) and caching headers.
    *   **(Low Priority):** Reduce unused JS (Lighthouse suggestion).
    *   **(Low Priority):** Optimize `/textures/particle.png` further (Lighthouse suggestion).
    *   **(Low Priority):** Properly size `/textures/mail.png` (Lighthouse suggestion).

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Vercel Deployment:**
    *   Successfully deployed after resolving BaseLayout import and compiler issues
    *   Reset repository to stable commit 5809f3d to ensure working state
    *   Verified all pages render correctly in production

*   **Lighthouse Analysis (Homepage - Deployed):**
    *   Performed Lighthouse analysis (Mobile) on `https://onlykdot.vercel.app/`.
    *   Overall Scores: Performance 83, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100.
    *   Identified key performance issues: FCP (3.1s), LCP (3.8s - render delay), Render-blocking CSS (fonts), Unused JS, Image optimization (`particle.png`, `mail.png`).

*   **Vercel Build Fix:**
    *   Identified and resolved `react-spring` vs React 19 peer dependency conflict by uninstalling the unused `react-spring` package.

## 3. Next Steps (Potential)

*   **Implement Homepage Performance Fixes:**
    *   Address unused JS (139KB bundle `extends.CIQnLglx.js`)
    *   Implement code splitting and lazy loading
    *   Optimize ThreeJS initialization
*   Implement the client-side project filtering logic in `ProjectFilters.jsx`.
*   Create shared Header and Footer components and integrate into `BaseLayout.astro`.
*   Populate remaining content (About text, skills list).
*   Refine visual styling across all components.
*   Conduct further performance testing (Lighthouse, profiling) and optimization after fixes.
*   Conduct thorough accessibility testing (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast).
