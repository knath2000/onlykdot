# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website (as of 2025-04-15)

## What Works

- Animated project card system is fully functional and supports multiple animated cards via the `isAnimated: true` frontmatter field.
- Astro Content Collections are used for all project data, with schema validation (including `isAnimated`).
- Astro image pipeline integration is robust; thumbnails are handled as Astro image objects and rendered correctly in React.
- Card layout, summary overlay, and interactive "See Animation" button are implemented and visually consistent.
- Debug logging and error handling for project data and images are in place.

## What's Left to Build

- Add more animated project cards as needed, ensuring each uses `isAnimated: true` and a valid thumbnail.
- Continue refining card styles and overlays as new feedback is received.
- Add more robust fallback handling for missing images or fields if needed.

## Current Status

- All major issues with animated card duplication, image handling, and schema mapping have been resolved.
- The system is ready for further expansion and new animated project cards.

## Known Issues

- 404 errors for missing font files (unrelated to project card system).
- If a project card is not animated as expected, verify the `isAnimated` field is present in the markdown and schema.
- Ensure all new images are added to `src/assets/project-thumbnails/` and referenced with a relative path in the markdown.
