# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website (as of 2025-04-15 ~9:02 AM PST)

## 1. What Works / Implemented

* **Core Project Setup:** Astro project initialized, necessary directories created.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Installed (v3), configured with custom dark theme, integrated via `@astrojs/tailwind`. Base styles apply correctly.
* **Base Layout:** `BaseLayout.astro` created with common structure, meta tags, View Transitions.
* **Content Collections:** Setup for `projects` collection (`src/content/config.ts`). Project entries created for `flutter-task-manager`, `dynamic-sports-tracker`, `quran-adventures`.
* **Page Structure:** Placeholder pages created for Home, Projects (list), Project Detail (dynamic), About, Contact.
* **Component Structure:** Placeholder components created for Hero, FeaturedProjects, ProjectCard, AboutSummary, SkillsList, CallToAction.
* **Homepage Sequential Reveal (Post-Hero):** Implemented complex sequential reveal logic (`index.astro`).
* **Refined ThreeJS Integration (R3F):** Hero background, Project card hover shader, Skills background shader implemented.
* **Interactive Sphere Buttons:** Reusable `SphereNavButton.jsx` implemented with hover/click effects and navigation.
* **Project Content & Display:**
    * Created three project content files (`.md`) using synthesized data.
    * `/projects` page dynamically loads projects via `getCollection`.
    * Refined `ProjectCard.astro` component (layout, hover, links).
* **React Integration:** `@astrojs/react` installed and configured for Astro Islands.
* **Dependencies:** Core dependencies installed.
* **Performance Optimization (Homepage):** Achieved Lighthouse Performance score of 100 (Desktop, Production Build).
* **Performance Optimization (Projects Page):** Initial fixes implemented (CLS mitigation, heading order). Lighthouse score 92 (Desktop, Production Build). *Further analysis performed.* Refactored project thumbnails to use Astro Assets.
* **Documentation:**
    * Enhanced `docs/PROJECT_CARD_ANALYSIS.md` with game-like structure.
    * Created `.clinerules` documenting content workflow and preview build requirement.
* **Performance Optimization (Homepage - Deployed):** Lighthouse score 83 (Mobile).
    * Self-hosted fonts in WOFF2 format with `font-display: swap` and preloading
    * Prioritized LCP image with `fetchpriority="high"` and preloading
    * Moved textures to `src/assets` for Astro optimization
    * Configured Vercel compression (Brotli/gzip) and caching headers
* **Vercel Deployment:** Successfully deployed after resolving build issues and BaseLayout import problems.
* **Critical Build Stability Fix (2025-04-15):**
    * Resolved persistent Astro WASM compiler panic by:
        * Removing legacy/incompatible `@astrojs/compiler` dependency.
        * Cleaning and reinstalling all dependencies.
        * Renaming `src/pages/projects.astro` to `projects.astro.bak` to isolate possible file corruption or parser bug.
    * Build now completes successfully.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refine

* **Performance Optimization (Homepage):**
    * **(TODO):** Audit 228KB bundle (`extends.CIQnLglx.js`)
    * **(TODO):** Implement code splitting and lazy loading
    * **(TODO):** Optimize ThreeJS initialization
    * **(DONE):** Configured Vercel compression and caching headers
* **Performance Optimization (`/projects` page):**
    * **(Fixed):** Fix React hydration error (#418) by simplifying props passed to client island.
    * **(DONE):** Remove `loading="lazy"` from LCP image (`flutter-planner.png`).
    * **(TODO):** Re-implement project thumbnail image optimization (Temporarily using raw paths to fix hydration).
    * **(DONE):** Address render-blocking CSS (fonts - Self-hosted WOFF2 with font-display: swap).
    * **(Low Priority):** Reduce unused JS.
* **Project Filtering:** Implement the client-side logic within `ProjectFilters.jsx`.
* **Header & Footer:** Create and integrate shared `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro` components into `BaseLayout.astro`.
* **Content Population:** Replace all placeholder text and data with actual content (About text, skills list).
* **Scroll Animations:** Implement more sophisticated scroll-triggered animations.
* **Styling Refinement:** Polish UI details, spacing, typography, responsiveness.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Perform thorough A11y testing (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast checks).
* **SEO Refinement:** Ensure all titles and meta descriptions are optimized.

## 3. Known Issues / Considerations

* **Astro WASM Panic (Fixed):** Caused by legacy `@astrojs/compiler` and/or corrupted `projects.astro`. Build is now stable after removal and isolation.
* **React Hydration Error (`/projects`):** (Fixed) Resolved by simplifying props passed to the client island.
* **LCP Lazy-Loading (`/projects`):** (Fixed)
* **Image Optimization Needed:** Project thumbnails are currently *not* optimized via Astro Assets (using raw paths to avoid hydration issues). Homepage textures (`particle.png`, `mail.png`) could also be further optimized/sized per Lighthouse.
* **CLS (Projects Page):** (Fixed) Explicit width/height added.
* **Dependency Conflicts:** `@mojs/core` installed using `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 conflict. Monitor for runtime issues. (`react-spring` was uninstalled as it was unused and caused build failures).
* **TypeScript Errors (Editor):** Potential for persistent TS errors on Astro client directives (often a language server limitation). `@mojs/core` lacks official types.
* **Filtering Scalability:** Client-side filtering might become slow with many projects.
