# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website (as of 2025-04-16 @ 8:01 AM)

## What Works

- **Synchronized Page Transition:** The combined mo.js burst, CSS overlay animation, sphere fade-out, and button fade-out now trigger and run concurrently on button click. Transition logic is centralized in `OverlayManager.jsx`.
- **Sphere Interactivity:** Drag/hold rotation and bubble button hover/click interactions on the homepage hero sphere are fully functional.
- **Astro/React Integration:** The core pattern of using `OverlayManager.jsx` as the root React island, rendering `ThreeCanvas.jsx` and managing overlay/transition states, is working correctly.
- **Duplicate Rendering Fixed:** Issues causing duplicate spheres or invalid Astro island prop passing have been resolved.
- Animated project card system is fully functional on the projects page.
- **Modal Popup Implementation:** Clicking any project card now opens a detailed modal instead of navigating away.

- Astro Content Collections are used for project data.
- Astro image pipeline integration is robust for project cards.
- Card layout, summary overlay, and "See Animation" button are implemented.

## What's Left to Build

- **Project Detail Page Thumbnails:** Fix the missing thumbnails on individual project pages (`/projects/[slug]`).
- **Font Loading:** Fix the 404 errors for self-hosted fonts (`inter`, `poppins`).
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining console logs or commented-out code related to debugging.
- **Refinement:** Potentially refine transition animation timing or visuals further.
- Continue refining card styles and overlays as needed.
- Add more robust fallback handling for missing images or fields if needed.

## Current Status

- Core homepage interactivity (sphere drag, button clicks, synchronized page transition animation) is implemented and functional.
- Project card system is stable on the main projects page.
- Primary remaining tasks are fixing project detail page thumbnails and font loading issues.

## Known Issues

- **Missing Thumbnails on Project Detail Pages:** Thumbnails defined in project frontmatter are not appearing on the dynamic project detail pages.
- **404 errors for missing font files.**
- Preload warnings for fonts not used within a few seconds (likely related to 404s).
- If a project card is not animated as expected, verify the `isAnimated` field is present in the markdown and schema.
- Ensure all new images are added to `src/assets/project-thumbnails/` and referenced with a relative path in the markdown.
