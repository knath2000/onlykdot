# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website (as of 2025-04-14 ~11:59 AM PST)

## 1. What Works / Implemented

*   **Core Project Setup:** Astro project initialized, necessary directories created.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Installed (v3), configured with custom dark theme, integrated via `@astrojs/tailwind`. Base styles apply correctly.
*   **Base Layout:** `BaseLayout.astro` created with common structure, meta tags, View Transitions.
*   **Content Collections:** Setup for `projects` collection (`src/content/config.ts`). Project entries created for `flutter-task-manager`, `dynamic-sports-tracker`, `quran-adventures`.
*   **Page Structure:** Placeholder pages created for Home, Projects (list), Project Detail (dynamic), About, Contact.
*   **Component Structure:** Placeholder components created for Hero, FeaturedProjects, ProjectCard, AboutSummary, SkillsList, CallToAction.
*   **Homepage Sequential Reveal (Post-Hero):** Implemented complex sequential reveal logic (`index.astro`).
*   **Refined ThreeJS Integration (R3F):** Hero background, Project card hover shader, Skills background shader implemented.
*   **Interactive Sphere Buttons:** Reusable `SphereNavButton.jsx` implemented with hover/click effects and navigation.
*   **Project Content & Display:**
    *   Created three project content files (`.md`) using synthesized data.
    *   `/projects` page dynamically loads projects via `getCollection`.
    *   Refined `ProjectCard.astro` component (layout, hover, links).
*   **React Integration:** `@astrojs/react` installed and configured for Astro Islands.
*   **Dependencies:** Core dependencies installed.
*   **Performance Optimization (Homepage):** Achieved Lighthouse Performance score of 100 (Desktop, Production Build).
*   **Performance Optimization (Projects Page):** Initial fixes implemented (CLS mitigation, heading order). Lighthouse score 92 (Desktop, Production Build). *Further analysis performed.*
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Enhanced `docs/PROJECT_CARD_ANALYSIS.md` with game-like structure.
    *   Created `.clinerules` documenting content workflow and preview build requirement.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refine

*   **Performance Optimization (`/projects` page):**
    *   **(High Priority):** Fix React hydration error (#418).
    *   **(High Priority):** Remove `loading="lazy"` from LCP image (`flutter-planner.png`).
    *   **(High Priority):** Optimize project thumbnail images (resize, compress, WebP/AVIF).
    *   **(Medium Priority):** Address render-blocking CSS (fonts).
    *   **(Low Priority):** Reduce unused JS.
*   **Project Filtering:** Implement the client-side logic within `ProjectFilters.jsx`.
*   **Header & Footer:** Create and integrate shared `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro` components into `BaseLayout.astro`.
*   **Content Population:** Replace all placeholder text and data with actual content (About text, skills list).
*   **Scroll Animations:** Implement more sophisticated scroll-triggered animations.
*   **Styling Refinement:** Polish UI details, spacing, typography, responsiveness.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Perform thorough A11y testing (keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast checks).
*   **SEO Refinement:** Ensure all titles and meta descriptions are optimized.

## 3. Known Issues / Considerations

*   **React Hydration Error (`/projects`):** Lighthouse reported React error #418, indicating a server/client mismatch during island hydration. Needs investigation.
*   **LCP Lazy-Loading (`/projects`):** The current LCP image (`flutter-planner.png`) is incorrectly lazy-loaded, delaying rendering.
*   **Image Optimization Needed:** Project thumbnails are large and not in optimal formats, significantly impacting load time and payload size.
*   **CLS (Projects Page):** While mitigated with `min-h`, the root cause (client-side grid rendering) remains. Ensure images have explicit width/height matching aspect ratio.
*   **Dependency Conflicts:** `@mojs/core` installed using `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 conflict. Monitor for runtime issues. (`react-spring` was uninstalled as it was unused and caused build failures).
*   **TypeScript Errors (Editor):** Potential for persistent TS errors on Astro client directives (often a language server limitation). `@mojs/core` lacks official types.
*   **Filtering Scalability:** Client-side filtering might become slow with many projects.
