## What Works

- **Modal Popup Scrollability & Animated Border:** Modal popups for project details are now fully scrollable, with all content visually confined within the animated border. The scrollable area uses dynamic padding based on the border's strokeWidth, ensuring no content overlap.
- **Accessibility:** FocusTrap is used to preserve keyboard navigation and focus trapping in modals, with clickOutsideDeactivates enabled.
- **UI Polish:** The modal's inner container uses `overflow-hidden`, `max-h-[80vh]`, `max-w-sm`, `flex flex-col`, and rounded corners. The scrollable content uses `overflow-y-auto`, `max-h-full`, and dynamic padding.
- **AnimatedBorder:** Remains absolutely positioned (`inset-0`, `pointer-events-none`) and overlays the modal content correctly.
- **Synchronized Page Transition:** The combined mo.js burst, CSS overlay animation, sphere fade-out, and button fade-out now trigger and run concurrently on button click. Transition logic is centralized in `OverlayManager.jsx`.
- **Sphere Interactivity:** Drag/hold rotation and bubble button hover/click interactions on the homepage hero sphere are fully functional.
- **Astro/React Integration:** The core pattern of using `OverlayManager.jsx` as the root React island, rendering `ThreeCanvas.jsx` and managing overlay/transition states, is working correctly.
- **Duplicate Rendering Fixed:** Issues causing duplicate spheres or invalid Astro island prop passing have been resolved.
- **Animated project card system is fully functional on the projects page.**
- **Modal Popup Implementation:** Clicking any project card opens a detailed modal overlay with project information (title, description, thumbnail, tech stack, links) using animated transitions (scale, rotate) via Framer Motion and a mo.js burst effect. Body scroll is locked, and the modal can be closed via the Escape key or by clicking the backdrop.
- **Astro Content Collections are used for project data.**
- **Astro image pipeline integration is robust for project cards.**
- **Card layout, summary overlay, and "See Animation" button are implemented.**

## What's Left to Build

- **Project Detail Page Thumbnails:** Fix the missing thumbnails on individual project pages (`/projects/[slug]`).
- **Font Loading:** Fix the 404 errors for self-hosted fonts (`inter`, `poppins`).
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining console logs or commented-out code related to debugging.
- **Refinement:** Continue refining modal accessibility, scrollability, and border polish as needed.
- **Continue refining card styles and overlays as needed.**
- **Add more robust fallback handling for missing images or fields if needed.**

## Current Status

- Modal popups are now scrollable, accessible, and visually polished with animated border confinement.
- Core homepage interactivity (sphere drag, button clicks, synchronized page transition animation) is implemented and functional.
- Project card system is stable on the main projects page.
- Primary remaining tasks are fixing project detail page thumbnails and font loading issues.

## Known Issues

- **Missing Thumbnails on Project Detail Pages:** Thumbnails defined in project frontmatter are not appearing on the dynamic project detail pages.
- **404 errors for missing font files.**
- **Preload warnings for fonts not used within a few seconds (likely related to 404s).**
- **If a project card is not animated as expected, verify the `isAnimated` field is present in the markdown and schema.**
- **Ensure all new images are added to `src/assets/project-thumbnails/` and referenced with a relative path in the markdown.**
