# Project Brief: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Project Goal

To design and develop a visually stunning, highly performant, and engaging personal portfolio website using Astro and ThreeJS. The site will showcase software development projects and reflect the owner's technical skill, creativity, and attention to detail.

## 2. Core Objectives

*   **Showcase Projects:** Effectively present coding projects with descriptions, technologies, links, and visuals.
*   **Reflect Personal Brand:** Communicate technical expertise and creative flair.
*   **Achieve Top-Tier Performance:** Target excellent Lighthouse scores (>95) and Core Web Vitals on desktop.
*   **Engage Users:** Utilize sophisticated animations (Astro View Transitions, scroll animations) and ThreeJS for a memorable experience without compromising usability or performance.

## 3. Key Requirements

*   **Technology Stack:** Astro (latest), ThreeJS, Styling: Tailwind CSS, Astro Components.
*   **Design:** Dark theme primary (near-black base), vibrant accent colors, modern sans-serif typography, futuristic/sophisticated/tech-centric mood, responsive (desktop-first optimization).
*   **Structure:** Homepage (Hero acts as initial splash, followed by sequentially revealed sections: Featured Projects, About Summary, Skills, CTA via button clicks), Projects Page (Grid/List, Filtering), Project Detail Page (Dynamic, In-depth content), About Page, Contact Page (Direct Info: Email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
*   **Interactivity:** Homepage uses complex click-to-reveal transitions between sections (spin-out/slide-bounce-in via CSS/JS). Other pages use Astro View Transitions and simpler scroll-triggered animations (via Intersection Observer). Micro-interactions (hovers) and subtle ThreeJS effects enhance components. Custom loading animation planned.
*   **Performance:** Astro Islands, asset optimization (images, fonts), code splitting, lazy loading, minimal JS, efficient CSS, SSG preferred.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast, alt text.
*   **SEO:** Basic best practices (titles, metas, structure, Open Graph).

## 4. Scope

*   Initial build based on the defined structure and features.
*   Focus on desktop performance and experience first.
*   Implementation of core pages and project display functionality.
*   Integration of a foundational ThreeJS element.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   Lighthouse Scores > 95 (Desktop).
*   Meeting Core Web Vitals targets (Desktop).
*   Smooth 60fps performance during animations and interactions.
*   Positive user feedback on design and engagement.
*   Effective presentation of projects.
