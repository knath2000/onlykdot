  This div acts as the container for the ThreeJS canvas.
  Positioning (e.g., absolute, fixed) and z-index will depend on
  whether it's a background or a specific module.
  Using 'client:visible' or 'client:idle' defers loading/execution
  of the ThreeJS code until necessary, improving initial page performance.
